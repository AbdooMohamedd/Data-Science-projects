# Modeling Car Insurance Claim Outcomes

This project is part of the [Data Science Projects](https://github.com/AbdooMohamedd/Data-Science-projects) repository by [AbdooMohamedd](https://github.com/AbdooMohamedd). In this project, we aim to build a model to predict whether a customer will make a claim on their car insurance during the policy period.

## Project Structure

The project contains the following key components:

- **data/**: This folder contains the dataset files used in the analysis.
  - `car_insurance.csv`: Contains the car insurance data.
- **notebook/**: This folder contains the Jupyter notebook with the analysis.
  - `notebook.ipynb`: The notebook where the data is analyzed.

## Data Description

- **car_insurance.csv**: This file contains the car insurance data.
  - Columns: `customer_id`, `policy_period`, `claim`, `feature_1`, `feature_2`, ..., `feature_n`

## Analysis Overview

The analysis performed in this project includes:

1. **Loading and Preparing the Data**: Load data from CSV files into Pandas DataFrames.
2. **Feature Selection**: Identify the single feature that results in the best performing model, as measured by accuracy.
3. **Model Training**: Train models using different features and evaluate their performance.
4. **Result Analysis**: Determine the feature with the highest accuracy and create a summary DataFrame.

## Results

The results of the analysis include the identification of the best feature for predicting car insurance claims and the accuracy of the model using this feature.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
