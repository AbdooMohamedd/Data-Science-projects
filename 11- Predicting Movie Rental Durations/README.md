# Predicting Movie Rental Durations

This project is part of the [Data Science Projects](https://github.com/AbdooMohamedd/Data-Science-projects) repository by [AbdooMohamedd](https://github.com/AbdooMohamedd). In this project, we aim to predict the duration for which a movie will be rented based on various features.

## Project Structure

The project contains the following key components:
  - `movie_rentals.csv`: Contains data on movie rentals.
  - `notebook.ipynb`: The notebook where the data is analyzed.

## Data Description

- **movie_rentals.csv**: This file contains data on movie rentals.
  - Columns: `rental_id`, `movie_id`, `customer_id`, `rental_date`, `return_date`, `duration`, `genre`, `rating` and more 

## Analysis Overview

The analysis performed in this project includes:

1. **Loading and Preparing the Data**: Load data from CSV files into Pandas DataFrames.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the distribution and relationships of rental durations and other features.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features and preprocess the data for modeling.
4. **Model Training**: Train machine learning models to predict rental durations based on various features.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the models and select the best one.
6. **Result Analysis**: Analyze the results and provide insights on factors affecting rental durations.

## Results

The results of the analysis include the identification of key factors influencing rental durations and the accuracy of the predictive models.

## Getting Started
