## Introduction

This repository is a compilation of various data science projects that I have created. The projects range from simple analyses and visualizations to more complex machine learning models. Each project aims to solve a specific problem or explore a particular dataset.

## Projects

### Small Projects

Small projects are quick and concise, often focusing on a single concept or technique. They are great for beginners or for anyone looking to understand the basics of data science.


### Small Projects

1. **1- Exploring NYC Public School Test Result Scores**
   - Description: This project analyzes test result scores from NYC public schools to identify trends and insights that can help improve educational outcomes.
   - Technologies: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
   - [Link to Project](https://github.com/AbdooMohamedd/Data-Science-projects/tree/main/1-%20Exploring%20NYC%20Public%20School%20Test%20Result%20Scores)

2. **Project Name 2**
   - Description: Brief description of the project.
   - Technologies: List of technologies and tools used.

### Medium Projects

Medium projects are more extensive and may involve multiple steps or techniques. These projects provide a deeper understanding of data science workflows and methodologies.

1. **Project Name 1**
   - Description: Brief description of the project.
   - Technologies: List of technologies and tools used.
   - [Link to Project](./medium-projects/project-name-1)

2. **Project Name 2**
   - Description: Brief description of the project.
   - Technologies: List of technologies and tools used.

## Getting Started

To get started with any of the projects, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AbdooMohamedd/data-science-projects.git
   cd data-science-projects
   ```

2. **Navigate to the desired project folder:**

   ```bash
   cd small-projects/project-name-1
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**

   Each project has its own `requirements.txt` file. Install the dependencies using:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the project:**

   Follow the instructions provided in the project's README or documentation file to run the project.
