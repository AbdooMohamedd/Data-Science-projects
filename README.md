## Introduction

This repository is a compilation of various data science projects that I have created. The projects range from simple analyses and visualizations to more complex machine learning models. Each project aims to solve a specific problem or explore a particular dataset.

## Projects

### Small Projects

Small projects are quick and concise, often focusing on a single concept or technique. They are great for beginners or for anyone looking to understand the basics of data science.

1. **1- Exploring NYC Public School Test Result Scores**
   - Description: This project analyzes test result scores from NYC public schools to identify trends and insights that can help improve educational outcomes.

5. 5- Project: Customer Analytics: Preparing Data for Modeling

   - **Description**: This project involves transforming a DataFrame called `ds_jobs_transformed` to store the data from `customer_train.csv` much more efficiently. The goal is to optimize data types and filter the dataset based on specific criteria to reduce memory usage.
   - **Technologies**: Python, Pandas, Numpy
   - [Link to Project](https://github.com/AbdooMohamedd/Data-Science-projects/tree/main/5-%20Project%20Customer%20Analytics%20Preparing%20Data%20for%20Modeling)

6. 6- Exploring Airbnb Market Trends

   - **Description**: This project investigates the short-term rental market in New York using Airbnb listing data. It involves analyzing the dates of the earliest and most recent reviews, counting the number of private rooms, and calculating the average listing price. The results are combined into a summary DataFrame.
   - **Technologies**: Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, seaborn, matplotlib

7. **7- Modeling Car Insurance Claim Outcomes**
   - Description: This project aims to build a model to predict whether a customer will make a claim on their car insurance during the policy period.
   - Technologies: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, statsmodels
   - [Link to Project](https://github.com/AbdooMohamedd/Data-Science-projects/tree/main/7-%20Modeling%20Car%20Insurance%20Claim%20Outcomes)
  
8. 8- Hypothesis Testing with Men's and Women's Soccer Matches
    - **Description:** This project investigates whether more goals are scored in women's international soccer matches compared to men's. The analysis focuses on official FIFA World Cup matches since January 1, 2002, using statistical hypothesis testing to validate the hypothesis.
    - **Technologies:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Pingouin, Scipy
