## Introduction

This repository is a compilation of various data science projects that I have created. The projects range from simple analyses and visualizations to more complex machine learning models. Each project aims to solve a specific problem or explore a particular dataset.

## Projects

### Small Projects

Small projects are quick and concise, often focusing on a single concept or technique. They are great for beginners or for anyone looking to understand the basics of data science.

1. **1- Exploring NYC Public School Test Result Scores**
   - Description: This project analyzes test result scores from NYC public schools to identify trends and insights that can help improve educational outcomes.
   - Technologies: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
   - [Link to Project](https://github.com/AbdooMohamedd/Data-Science-projects/tree/main/1-%20Exploring%20NYC%20Public%20School%20Test%20Result%20Scores)

2. **2- Netflix Data Analysis**
   - Description: This project analyzes Netflix data to determine if movie lengths are getting shorter and to identify the most frequent movie duration in the 1990s as well as the number of short action movies released in the 1990s.
   - Technologies: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

3. **3- Visualizing the History of Nobel Prize Winners**
   - Description: This project analyzes Nobel Prize data to answer several key questions about the demographics and trends of laureates.
   - Technologies: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

4. **4- Analyzing Crime in Los Angeles**
   - Description: This project analyzes crime data in Los Angeles to help the Los Angeles Police Department gain insights about the crimes in the city.
   - Technologies: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
   - [Link to Project](https://github.com/AbdooMohamedd/Data-Science-projects/tree/main/4-%20Analyzing%20Crime%20in%20Los%20Angeles)

4. **5- Project: Customer Analytics: Preparing Data for Modeling

   - **Description**: This project involves transforming a DataFrame called `ds_jobs_transformed` to store the data from `customer_train.csv` much more efficiently. The goal is to optimize data types and filter the dataset based on specific criteria to reduce memory usage.
   - **Technologies**: Python, Pandas, Numpy

### Medium Projects

Medium projects are more extensive and may involve multiple steps or techniques. These projects provide a deeper understanding of data science workflows and methodologies.

1. **Project Name 1**
   - Description: Brief description of the project.
   - Technologies: List of technologies and tools used.
   - [Link to Project](./medium-projects/project-name-1)

2. **Project Name 2**
   - Description: Brief description of the project.
   - Technologies: List of technologies and tools used.
   - [Link to Project](./medium-projects/project-name-2)

## Getting Started

To get started with any of the projects, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AbdooMohamedd/data-science-projects.git
   cd data-science-projects
   ```

2. **Navigate to the desired project folder:**

   ```bash
   cd project-name-1
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**

   Each project specifies its dependencies in the documentation. Install the dependencies using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the project:**

   Follow the instructions provided in the project's README or documentation file to run the project.
