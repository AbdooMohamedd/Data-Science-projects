# Predictive Modeling for Agriculture

This project is part of the [Data Science Projects](https://github.com/AbdooMohamedd/Data-Science-projects) repository by [AbdooMohamedd](https://github.com/AbdooMohamedd). In this project, we aim to assist farmers in selecting the best crops to plant each season and identify the single most importance feature for predictive performance. by using machine learning to predict crop yields based on soil conditions.

## Project Structure

The project contains the following key components:

  - `soil_measures.csv`: Contains soil metrics data.
  - `notebook.ipynb`: The notebook where the data is analyzed.

## Data Description

- **soil_measures.csv**: This file contains essential soil metrics.
  - Columns: `N`, `P`, `K`, `pH`, `crop`

## Analysis Overview

The analysis performed in this project includes:

1. **Loading and Preparing the Data**: Load data from CSV files into Pandas DataFrames.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the distribution and relationships of soil metrics and crop yields.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features and preprocess the data for modeling.
4. **Model Training**: Train machine learning models to predict crop yields based on soil metrics.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the models and select the best one.
6. **Result Analysis**: Analyze the results and provide recommendations for farmers.

## Results

The results of the analysis include the identification of the best soil conditions for different crops and the accuracy of the predictive models.
