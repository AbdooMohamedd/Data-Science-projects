# Nobel Prize Data Analysis

This Jupyter Notebook analyzes Nobel Prize data, focusing on various aspects such as the most commonly awarded gender, birth country, and more. Below are the detailed explanations for each question addressed in the notebook.

## Questions Addressed

### 1. Most Commonly Awarded Gender
This analysis calculates the most commonly awarded gender by counting the occurrences of each value in the "sex" column and finding the one with the highest count.

### 2. Most Commonly Awarded Birth Country
This analysis determines the most commonly awarded birth country by counting the occurrences of each value in the "birth_country" column and identifying the most frequent one.

### 3. Decade with Highest Number of Laureates from the USA
This analysis filters the DataFrame to include only laureates born in the USA. It then creates a new column representing the decade and finds the decade with the highest number of laureates from the USA.

### 4. Decade and Category with the Highest Proportion of Female Laureates
This analysis calculates the proportion of female laureates per decade and category. It then identifies the decade and category with the highest proportion of female laureates and stores this information in a dictionary.

### 5. First Female Laureate and Her Category
This analysis filters the DataFrame to include only female laureates, sorts them by the year they were awarded, and extracts the name and category of the first female laureate.

## Visualizations

### 1. Bar Plot of Organization Counts
This bar plot visualizes the counts of organizations that have appeared at least twice in the dataset, showing the frequency of awards associated with different organizations.

### 2. Count Plot of Duplicated Individuals
This count plot visualizes the duplicated individuals (laureates who have won more than once), showing the counts of each duplicated individual and helping to identify the most frequently awarded laureates.

## Conclusion

This notebook provides a comprehensive analysis of Nobel Prize data, answering key questions about the most commonly awarded gender, birth country, and more. The visualizations further aid in understanding the distribution and frequency of awards across different categories and organizations.
