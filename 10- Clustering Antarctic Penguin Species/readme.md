# Clustering Antarctic Penguin Species

![Penguins in Antarctica](https://imgur.com/orZWHly.png)

## Project Overview

You have been tasked with supporting a team of researchers who have been collecting data on penguins in Antarctica. While the dataset includes various measurements, it lacks information on the species of the penguins. Your goal is to use data science techniques to identify and cluster the different species within the dataset.

## Data Description

**Origin of the Data**: The dataset was collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER, a member of the Long Term Ecological Research Network.

The dataset is provided in CSV format as `penguins.csv` and consists of the following columns:

While the species of each penguin is not recorded, it is known that **at least three** species are native to the region: **Adelie**, **Chinstrap**, and **Gentoo**. Your task is to apply clustering techniques to identify these groups within the dataset.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python** for data analysis.
- **Pandas** for data manipulation.
- **Scikit-learn** for clustering algorithms.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive data exploration.

## Project Goals

- Explore the dataset and perform data preprocessing.
- Apply clustering algorithms to identify distinct groups (species) within the dataset.
- Visualize the clusters and analyze the characteristics that differentiate them.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AbdooMohamedd/Data-Science-projects.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd 10-%20Clustering%20Antarctic%20Penguin%20Species
   ```
3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib sklearn
   ```
4. Explore the data and run the clustering analysis in the Jupyter notebook.
